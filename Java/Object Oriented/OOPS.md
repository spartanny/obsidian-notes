### Composition vs Inheritance

**Inheritance** : inheriting ; basically parent child relationship

 > also called **IS-A** relationship>

`class parent {`
	`parent();`
	`...`
`}`

`class child extends parent {`
	`child() {`
		`super();`
			`...`
	`}`
	`...`
`}`

**Composition :** composing; a complex object from collection of simple objects

describes a class that has reference of objects of one or more classes in its instance variable

> also called HAS-A relationship

`class Composition {`
	`private Class1 c1;`
	`private Class2 c2;`
`}`
